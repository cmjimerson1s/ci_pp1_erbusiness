## Design

### Design Choices
The website is designed with engaging photos and a fun color scheme to try and evoke the feeling of excitement or adventure, while also drawing attention to the element of time constraints that are present in the base gameplay of the escape room experience. 

### Colour
The color choice is predominantly orange, with accents of black and white. Orange is a warm color that is associated with excitement, adventure, sunshine, and fun. It evokes a sense of high energy and invigoration that meets the pace that the escape room game usually has. It’s also contemplative, and shares in the need for thought and logic in solving the puzzle.

### Fonts
Bold uppercase font Staatliches is used for the titles, and logo. It leans into the modern nature of the escape room games, as it’s a new entertainment industry while also being striking against the font Raleway. Raleway makes up the bulk of the content, which is a font that is simplistic in it's design but still stylistic.

### Structure
The structure of the website is reminiscent of many other layouts allowing for innate intuitive traversal across the five pages that make up the site. Each page has the company logo, navigation links, and a footer that are identical and shared across all pages to allow cohesion to the user experience. The pages are as follows, following from the left to the right across the navigation bar…
<br>
-Home: A homepage with a section defining escape rooms and listing reasons the user should choose the business. 
<br>
-About: A page that names the C-Suite of the company, with accompanied photos of the individuals.
<br>
-Rooms: This page shows the three rooms the business has to offer, along with a description of each, and a difficulty level. 
<br>
-Contact: A page containing important operating information such as operating hours, phone, email, and business location with a Google Map pin. 
<br>
-Book Now: This is a form that allows customers to request a time and date for a booking as well as which rooms they would like to reserve.
